## Project Overview

The **Game of quizz** was developed for a mobile app development subject. Used was **Kotlin** and **Android Studio** to create this app. The purpose of the app is to test the user's general knowledge on the app and encourage users to practice more if they don't get satisfaction on their results.

The app focuses on the requirements of the assignment and meet the expectations and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The goal of my app is to encourage people to test their common knowledge and gain knowledge from it as well. 

### Key Features:
- When opening the app, the user is greated with straight forward information on the app and what to do as well as indicating how to begin the quizz.
- Simple to understand and easy to work with making the app easy to operate.
- Once completing the app there will be more comments on what to do next so the user is not lost when operating the app.

These features simply aim to provide a ease of use feeling for the user, especially for those who might be challenged.

## Design Considerations

My design for the **Game of quizz** was based on these ideas and considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The way the app is structured with minimal distractions and easy to read makes it user friendly.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
