## Project Overview

The **Game of quizz** was developed for a mobile app development subject. Used was **Kotlin** and **Android Studio** to create this app. The purpose of the app is to test the user's general knowledge on the app and encourage users to practice more if they don't get satisfaction on their results.

The app focuses on the requirements of the assignment and meet the expectations and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The goal of my app is to encourage people to test their common knowledge and gain knowledge from it as well. 

### Key Features:
- When opening the app, the user is greated with straight forward information on the app and what to do as well as indicating how to begin the quizz.
- Simple to understand and easy to work with making the app easy to operate.
- Once completing the app there will be more comments on what to do next so the user is not lost when operating the app.

These features simply aim to provide a ease of use feeling for the user, especially for those who might be challenged.

## Design Considerations

My design for the **Game of quizz** was based on these ideas and considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The way the app is structured with minimal distractions and easy to read makes it user friendly.
   
2. **How responsive the app is**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity of the app**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **If the app is able to handle what is being processed through it**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control. This is where my codes were pushed constanly every change that I have made. GitHub stored my codes and changes of every time i pushed my code through.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the creation of my app, I have gone throgh a few challenges with my app:

1. **I had a 403 push error**: When i was ready to start pushing my code onto my github repositry in android studio, I ran into with pusing the code. Everytime i pushed it through the same way I learnt how to push my code, I had an issue.
   - **Pushing it through files to bypass my issue**: I went through my files and used CMD to push my code through onto github which finally allowed me to push my code. And rather it being in my own reposity, i pushed it stright into the classroom reposity to decrease the stress later on.
   
2. **My app screens not displaying**: When running my app on the emulator, The app would work perfectly but when I finished answering all the questions, the app wouldn't switch screens to the results and review screens. 
   - **Correcting this issue**: Once realising the issue was my 2 screens not displaying even though I have gone and correctly refrenced my screens and ensured that they all work in conjuction to eachother, I eventually had a look in my ActivityManifest file and realised that there were 2 screens (Activity screens) missing which was not allowing my screens to fucntion as they should have.  

After experiencing these issue, I have realised that I should always go through my work and my manifest file to ensure that every screen that I will need is declared.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Moving wave background**: I would really like for my apps background that i have right now currently to be a moving wave background.
2. **The app to display the users name when viewing the results of your answers once completing the quizz as well as know who it is once the user puts in their id number**: I would like my app to be very active between the users so when ever the user puts their ID number into the app, it automatically knows who it is and shows your name once you've completed the quizz and displays with a message encouraging you on.  
3. **Different style's of buttons to be visually pleasing to the user**: Although having the buttons in a see through style making it pleasing to the users. I would really love to change the shapes of the buttons and use a gradient color background to be pleasing to the users.
